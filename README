# PCAP Triage Pipeline

Beginner-friendly workflow to capture packets, extract key indicators (DNS + TLS SNI + protocol stats), and generate a clean Markdown report you can show on GitHub.

## What this does (in plain English)
1. **Capture traffic** (pcapng) while you browse or run test commands.
2. **Extract signals**:
   - DNS lookups (domain → IP)
   - TLS SNI (what hostname a TLS connection is asking for)
   - Protocol hierarchy stats (what types of traffic were seen)
3. **Generate outputs** you can commit:
   - `*.pcapng` (optional—usually don’t publish raw captures)
   - `*.dns.txt`, `*.sni.txt`, `*.protocols.txt`
   - `report.md` (your final “incident-style” summary)

## Why this matters
This is the core of **network visibility**:
- “What did this machine try to reach?”
- “Was it DNS or encrypted TLS?”
- “Which protocols were active?”
- “Do we see discovery/noise (mDNS/ARP), or real outbound behavior?”

## Quickstart (WSL / Ubuntu)
### Install tools
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y tshark wireshark-common
```
